          Analyzing  Lending club case study using EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis )
          
Problem Statement : 
          A consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. 
          When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval 
          based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
          1. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of 
              business to the company
          2. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving 
              the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

Solution :  To identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking 
          actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher
          interest rate, etc.

Technologies Used: 1. Visual Studio code
                   2. Jupiter Notebook
                   3. Python 3.0
                   4. Numpy,Pandas, Matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn
                   
 Conclusions: 1. High loan amount & interest rate for lower income group
              2. High installment and longer repayment term
              3. Home ownership (other) and loan purpose (car, moving or small business)
              4. Residential state and loan purpose
              5. Income group and loan purpose
